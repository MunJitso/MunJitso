### 2 years of just exploring without making a real projects yaaay

Hello I'm 16 yo teen, studying boring stuff at school, that's not I hate learning, learning is like oxygen ( who calls me nerd is a loser, dieeee ), I like maths, physics, programming(even we dont study it at school which not sucks actually ), so yeah that's what u should know about me.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on minecraft plugins..
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... hmmm.. JAVA??
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on.. n-nothing yet??
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help in Stackoverflow and i get inspired in github (imagine a person get inspired from a code rather than a the project itself).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: u can't LMAO. ( there's a way )
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: living isnt fun.
